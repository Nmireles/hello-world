# hello-world
This is an example repository

I have used GitHub before in an academic setting with group members. I want to increase my skills individually, and I want to start from the beginning. I find that reteaching yourself things again and again from the beginnning adds many insights that may have been missed the first time. I'm also very big on sharing technology that can improve the world. If we can all chip in our skills, I feel we can accomplish many goals together as a society.
